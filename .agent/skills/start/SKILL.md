# /start — global session start

Every repository gets the same first step; each repository may add its own.

## 1. Brief (always)

From the repository root run the Total Recall brief, via the repo launcher when
one exists:

```bash
./total-recall brief      # or: npx total-recall brief
```

It is read-only and prints, for the repo you are in: local time, timezone and
UTC; branch, dirty files, last commit; the project id (random UUID) and the
project groups it belongs to; the compiled rules count and when they were
compiled; installed skills; composable commands (with risk class); secrets
health as **counts only** (rotation due, reused values, untracked); pending
daemon tasks; mesh status; in-progress and planned trackers; openwiki pages; and
what to do next. Add `--mesh` to ping every mesh node, `--json` to parse it.

If `brief` is missing (`Unknown command: brief`), the global commands are not
installed on this machine: say so and fall back to `npx total-recall --help`,
`git status`, and the repo's openwiki.

## 2. Repo start (when present)

If the brief's **Next** line names a repo start skill
(`.agent/skills/start/SKILL.md` in that repo), read it fully and follow it —
servers, logins, browser pane, anything specific to that product lives there,
never here. If there is none, read the openwiki entry page and the repo's
`repo-expert` skill it names before changing code.

## 3. Report to the user

Keep it short:

1. One line: repo, branch, what is in progress (trackers), anything uncommitted.
   Then the domain in one line: providers it holds keys for, integrations,
   automations, launchers — this is what you may explore and run (through the
   Total Recall CLI and the repo's own launchers) without asking where things are.
2. The brief's **Warnings**, each with the command that shows detail. Never
   print secret values or masked fragments; counts and key names only.
3. What the repo's start skill did (server up, URL opened…), if it ran.
4. Ask what to work on only if the user has not already said.

## Rules

- Do not fix warnings during /start unless the user asks; list them. A warning
  that blocks the work the user asked for gets fixed as part of that work.
- Data freshness: say when something the brief reports is old (for example
  openwiki last updated months ago, surfaces not compiled recently).
- Everything here goes through the Total Recall CLI. If a step is repeated in
  every session, add it to `brief` (`total-recall command update brief …
  --global`) instead of repeating it by hand.
