# Project Management (Universal)

## Purpose

This is the **universal, repo-agnostic** project management system. It defines the mechanics — file structure, naming, Kanban folders, tracker conventions, and standard operating modes — that every repo uses to turn ideas into GitHub issues, pull requests, and trackable execution plans.

It does **not** contain repo-specific facts (what "done" means for a given product, which architecture reminders matter, current epic status, GitHub repo name, prioritization order). Those live in a **repo-specific overlay skill**. This skill is the shared substrate; the overlay is the delta.

## ALL PROJECT MANAGEMENT MUST BE SSSS COMPLIANT

> **ABSOLUTE RULE: EVERYTHING NEEDS TO BE SSSS.**
> I shouldn't have to tell you this every time. When planning tasks, writing PRDs, or outlining architectures, the underlying data persistence, memory, configurations, rules, integration settings, network policies, or feature flags MUST ALWAYS be designed using SSSS (Structured Semantic Syntax System) VFS document primitives. Never invent arbitrary databases, random JSON/YAML files, or traditional CRUD stores for application state. Everything flows through SSSS.

## Step 0 — Always resolve the repo-specific overlay first

Before doing anything else, check whether the current repo has its own overlay skill at:

```
.agent/skills/<repo-slug>-project-management/SKILL.md
```

Repository-specific overlays may extend this generic method. Discover and read
the overlay in the current repository; do not infer another project's tracker.

- **If it exists**: read it. It defines the product/domain-specific layer — definition of done, severity/blocker test, architecture reminders, GitHub repo name and branch strategy, deployment and testing specifics, and any overrides to the prioritization order below. This global skill still governs the file mechanics (folder layout, naming, tracker syntax); the overlay never needs to redefine those.
- **If it does not exist**: proceed using the generic defaults in this skill, and mention to the user that this repo would benefit from its own `<repo-slug>-project-management` overlay skill (see "Creating a repo-specific overlay" below).

## Rule: Never hardcode the active project or epic in a skill file

Skill files are read at the start of every session and are easy to forget to update — hardcoded "current phase" or "current epic" text goes stale fast and then actively misleads future agents (this is exactly what happened before this skill was standardized: a copy of this file kept claiming an epic was "in progress" long after another copy of the same file had it marked "completed & archived"). Skills describe **process**, not **current state**.

Resolve the actual active work dynamically, in this order, every time:

1. The user's latest explicit instruction in the current conversation.
2. A root `HANDOFF.md`, if the repo has one.
3. The active `*_PROJECT_TRACKER.md` file(s) under `docs/projects/in-progress/`.
4. Current GitHub issues or board items — only after the local project docs are checked.
5. `docs/projects/DEFERRED_BACKLOG.md` — only for deferred or parking-lot work.

If sources disagree, prefer the user's latest instruction, then update whichever source is stale so the next agent doesn't repeat the mistake.

## The Standard: 4-File Kanban Documentation System

All project documentation lives in `docs/projects/`, organized as a Kanban board.

### Kanban folders

| Folder | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `backlog/` | Rough ideas not yet scoped |
| `planned/` | Scoped but not yet started |
| `in-progress/` | Active work |
| `completed/` | Shipped projects (moved here after archival) |
| `archived/` | Abandoned or superseded projects |
| `DEFERRED_BACKLOG.md` | **Global safety net** — deferred tasks and unfinished items extracted from completed trackers |

A repo doesn't need every folder from day one (`backlog/` and `archived/` are commonly added later) — but never invent alternate folder names.

### Per-project document set

Every **new project or feature** gets its own dedicated set of **4 fresh documents** in its own sub-folder. Never append to another project's documents — if you're starting new work, create new documents; if you're continuing existing work, find and use that project's existing documents.

**Folder structure mandate:**

```
docs/projects/<kanban-state>/<PROJECT_PREFIX>/
```

| # | Document | Path (example, in-progress) | Naming Pattern |
|---|----------|------------------------------|-----------------|
| 1 | **PRD** | `docs/projects/in-progress/<PROJECT_PREFIX>/<PROJECT_PREFIX>_PRD.md` | `<PROJECT_PREFIX>_PRD` |
| 2 | **Architecture** | `docs/projects/in-progress/<PROJECT_PREFIX>/<PROJECT_PREFIX>_ARCHITECTURE.md` | `<PROJECT_PREFIX>_ARCHITECTURE` |
| 3 | **Dev Plan** | `docs/projects/in-progress/<PROJECT_PREFIX>/<PROJECT_PREFIX>_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md` | `<PROJECT_PREFIX>_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN` |
| 4 | **Tracker** | `docs/projects/in-progress/<PROJECT_PREFIX>/<PROJECT_PREFIX>_PROJECT_TRACKER.md` | `<PROJECT_PREFIX>_PROJECT_TRACKER` |

Agents MUST move the entire project **folder** (not just loose files) between Kanban directories as status changes.

Some repos also keep root-level **master/umbrella documents** (e.g. `<PRODUCT>_PRD.md` directly under `docs/projects/`) as a high-level reference for overall product vision — distinct from, and not a substitute for, per-project docs. Whether a repo uses this pattern is a repo-specific decision (see the overlay skill).

### Naming the project prefix

`PROJECT_PREFIX` MUST be:

- **ALL CAPS WITH UNDERSCORES** (screaming snake case)
- **Descriptive of the specific project/feature** — not a generic label
- **Unique** — never reuse another project's prefix

> **NEVER use generic filenames** like `PRD.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `DEV_PLAN.md`, or `PROJECT_TRACKER.md`. Always prefix with the project name, e.g. `STRIPE_BILLING_INTEGRATION_PRD.md`. This is a protocol violation, not a style preference — it prevents namespace collisions across projects and repos.

> **ABSOLUTE INVARIANT: NO EPHEMERAL PLANNING ARTIFACTS.** Never create an `implementation_plan.md`, `task.md`, or `walkthrough.md` scratch file. All planning is redirected to these canonical project documents.

### Document header convention

Every project document starts with:

```markdown
# <PROJECT_PREFIX> — <Document Type>

> **Project Prefix**: `<PROJECT_PREFIX>`
> **Kanban State**: 📋 Planned / 🏗️ In Progress / ✅ Completed
> **Author**: <author>
> **Date**: YYYY-MM-DD

---
```

A repo-specific overlay may extend this with additional frontmatter (e.g. YAML frontmatter for a schema the repo already uses) — that's an addition, not a replacement.

### Tracker convention

The tracker uses standard markdown checkboxes — this is strictly required because tooling and background scripts parse these files:

```markdown
## ⏳ Phase N: <Phase Name>

Goal: <one-line goal>

- [x] Completed task with [linked file](file:///path/to/file)
- [ ] Pending task
- [/] In-progress task

## Verification Log

- YYYY-MM-DD: `command` — result
```

- Use `- [x]` for complete, `- [/]` for in-progress, `- [ ]` for pending. Never plain bullets or numbered lists for tasks.
- Every tracker MUST include a final phase dedicated to testing and verification. A project cannot move to `completed/` without that phase fully checked off.
- Change the phase header emoji from `⏳` to `✅` when all items in that phase are complete.
- Always update the tracker first when completing a task — don't ask permission to check a box; if the work is verified, check it off, then propose the next item.

### Archival rule

When completing a project, the agent MUST:

1. Verify the testing phase is fully checked off — a project cannot move to `completed/` without it.
2. Move the project folder from `in-progress/` to `completed/`.
3. Extract any unchecked `- [ ]` items or future-enhancement ideas from the tracker.
4. Append them to `DEFERRED_BACKLOG.md` under the project's section heading.
5. Never delete deferred items — preserve them for future sessions.

### The SWE Project Lifecycle

1. **Discovery** (PRD & Architecture) — define *what* is being built and *how* the systems connect.
2. **Planning** (Dev Plan & Tracker) — break the architecture into a step-by-step plan, then extract binary yes/no tasks into the tracker.
3. **Execution** — never code blindly; every PR checks off a specific tracker box. Don't let work drift into a later phase while an earlier one is incomplete.

### Architecture & documentation sync

Before closing out a major project or phase, verify whether architectural artifacts (`ARCHITECTURE.md`, a `repo-expert`-style skill, or equivalent) need updating. Code is not done until the repo's own memory of itself reflects it.

## Operating Modes

### 1. Planning Mode

Use when the user asks what to work on, what matters, or how close the project is to its next milestone.

1. Resolve the active work per the "Active Project Resolution" rule above.
2. Check whether the repo-specific readiness/verification walkthrough (see overlay skill) has been completed.
3. Identify blockers before polish work.
4. Select 3–7 issues for the session, not 20.

```md
## This week's focus
[One sentence]

## Do first
1. [Issue/task]
2. [Issue/task]
3. [Issue/task]

## Do not touch yet
- [Backlog idea]
- [Non-critical distraction]

## Biggest risk
[The thing most likely to block or break this]
```

### 2. Triage Mode

Use when the user reports bugs, confusion, errors, screenshots, logs, or anxiety about the project.

Classify each item by severity, area, whether it blocks the repo's core workflow, and next action:

- `P0-critical`: blocks the core workflow, data safety, or production operation.
- `P1-high`: seriously damages the core workflow but has a workaround.
- `P2-medium`: annoying or incomplete, but usage can continue.
- `P3-low`: polish, copy, visual cleanup.

Blocker test (repo-specific overlay defines the concrete workflow this refers to):

> Would this prevent the product from being safely used, correctly built, or reliably deployed?

```md
## Triage

### P0 / Blocker
- [Item] → [Issue/action]

### P1
- [Item] → [Issue/action]

### P2/P3
- [Item] → Backlog unless already in current scope

## Next move
[One concrete step]
```

### 3. Feature Development Tracking Mode

Use when executing a multi-phase project via its `*_PROJECT_TRACKER.md`. Follow the Tracker convention above exactly. Maintain momentum: when one task is checked off, immediately propose the next.

### 4. Issue Creation Mode

Use when converting a concern into a GitHub issue. A good issue is small enough to complete and test — never "fix app", "improve UI", or "clean up codebase".

```md
## Goal
What should be true when this is done?

## Why this matters
[Repo-specific: how does this protect stability / unblock users / reduce risk?]

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Specific testable outcome
- [ ] Specific testable outcome

## Test path
How should this be manually tested?

## Notes
Links, screenshots, logs, related files, or related issues.
```

### 5. Pull Request Review Mode

Use when reviewing a PR or deciding whether work is safe to merge.

Review against:

- Does it close or advance a real issue?
- Does it help the repo's current priority (per the overlay skill)?
- Does it introduce obvious runtime risk?
- Does it respect the repo's architecture (see overlay skill's architecture reminders)?
- Does it avoid exposing secrets or credentials?
- Does it have a clear test path?

```md
## Review

### Summary
[What this PR changes]

### Must fix before merge
- [ ] [Blocking concern]

### Should fix soon
- [ ] [Non-blocking concern]

### Test before merge
- [ ] [Manual test]

### Decision
Approve / Request changes / Comment only
```

### 6. Readiness / Verification Walkthrough Mode

The most important stability or readiness test for any product: a clean-account, no-shortcuts walkthrough of the real core workflow. The overlay skill defines what that workflow actually is (e.g. "sign up → create workspace → send a message" or "deploy → initialize → run 24/7 without intervention"). Never declare something stable or ready based only on code progress — prove it with a walkthrough.

```md
## Readiness walkthrough

### Environment
- Date:
- Environment/account used:

### Steps
- [ ] [Repo-specific core-workflow step]
- [ ] [Repo-specific core-workflow step]

### Final call
- [ ] Ready
- [ ] Not ready; blockers listed below
```

### 7. User Overwhelm Mode

Use when the user feels lost, flooded, or unsure what matters.

- Reduce scope immediately.
- Identify the next concrete action.
- Re-anchor to the current tracker or readiness walkthrough.
- Turn chaos into 1–3 tasks. Don't dump a giant plan unless asked for one.

## GitHub Management Rules

### Issues & Pull Requests

Every issue needs: goal, why it matters, acceptance criteria, test path. Every PR needs: summary, related issue, impact, test checklist.

### Branches

Default assumption is **trunk-based development** — a single active trunk branch, short-lived `feat/`, `bugfix/`, `chore/` branches merged quickly. The overlay skill may override this (e.g. a repo using a `production`/`main` split with an auto-sync watcher) — check it before assuming.

### Feature flags

New major features or sweeping architectural changes should be hidden behind a feature flag until verified stable, so trunk-based merges don't destabilize the live product. Strip the flag and dead fallback code once the feature is stable — that cleanup is itself trackable work, not something to leave indefinitely.

### Deployment & testing

Deployment mechanics and test-runner specifics (Vitest config, environment matching, mocking conventions, deploy scripts) are repo-specific — defer to the repo's own `code-quality`, `test`, `push`/`deploy` skills, and to the overlay skill's "architecture reminders" section. Universal rule regardless of repo: **verify → commit → push → verify**, and never skip code-quality checks before pushing.

### Labels

Suggested defaults — Type: `bug`, `feature`, `cleanup`, `docs`, `security`. Priority: `P0-critical`, `P1-high`, `P2-medium`, `P3-low`. Area labels are repo-specific.

## Prioritization Framework (default — overlay skill may override)

1. Data safety and security.
2. Core workflow reliability (the thing the product exists to do).
3. Data/state integrity.
4. Usability of the core path.
5. Cost/usage boundaries and reporting loops.
6. Polish.
7. New features.

When in doubt, choose the task that gets a real user through the product with less friction, over a task that adds something new.

## Decision Rules

**When a new idea appears**, ask: Does it help the current priority? Is it required for the readiness walkthrough? Does it reduce risk? Can it be tested this week? If not, backlog it.

**When a bug appears**, ask: Does it block the core workflow? Does it affect data safety? Does it create cost risk? Does it make the product look broken to a user? If yes to any, it's a blocker.

**When the user asks "are we close?"**, answer from evidence, not vibes: Has the readiness walkthrough been run? How many blockers remain? Can a user get through the product without explanation?

## Parallel Task Queue (Never Idle)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When ANY background command is running (build, deploy, git push, install), immediately pull the next task from this queue rather than idling on the status check.

**Tier 1 — Immediate value**
1. Push/sync the active branch per the repo's branch strategy
2. Update `HANDOFF.md` with current session state, if the repo uses one
3. Check and update project trackers with completed work
4. Commit any uncommitted local changes (only when asked to commit)

**Tier 2 — Code quality & maintenance**
5. Run the repo's own type-check / lint entrypoints (never raw `tsc`/`eslint` if the repo has wrapper scripts — check its `code-quality` skill)
6. Update skill documentation if any skill is out of date
7. Verify trackers match actual repo state
8. Scan recently modified files for stray `TODO`/`FIXME`/`HACK`

**Tier 3 — Documentation & planning**
9. Draft/update dev plans for backlog projects
10. Triage known blockers from the active tracker
11. Update the repo's `repo-expert`-style skill if architecture changed
12. Draft GitHub issues for discovered bugs

**Tier 4 — Hardening**
13. Audit for expired/rotated keys, hardcoded secrets
14. Check for critical dependency vulnerabilities
15. Verify feature flags are gating unreleased features correctly

**Tier 5 — Performance & UX debt**
16. Flag oversized files/functions for refactor
17. Audit accessibility (missing `aria-label`, keyboard nav) on recently touched UI
18. Check test coverage on recently modified files

**Rules:** never repeat the same queue item twice in a session without new information; log completed queue items in the session summary; when the queue is exhausted, generate new items by scanning the repo for improvements.

## What Not To Do

- Don't create huge, vague tasks ("fix app", "clean up codebase").
- Don't treat new features as more important than active blockers.
- Don't merge untested changes casually.
- Don't hardcode current project/epic status in this or any skill file (see the rule above).
- Don't duplicate this skill's mechanics into a repo-specific overlay — reference this skill instead.
- Don't answer "are we close?" on vibes instead of evidence.

## Creating a repo-specific overlay skill

If the current repo doesn't have `.agent/skills/<repo-slug>-project-management/`, create one using the `skill` skill's standard format (`SKILL.md` + `scripts/` + `references/` + `evals/` + `subagents/`). It should contain **only the delta** from this universal skill:

- What "done"/"stable"/"ready" concretely means for this product, and the readiness walkthrough steps.
- The severity/blocker test in this repo's own terms.
- Architecture reminders a reviewer needs (stack, key modules, invariants).
- The repo's actual GitHub repo name and branch strategy if it differs from trunk-based default.
- Any prioritization or deployment/testing overrides.

Point to this global skill for everything else — don't re-paste the Kanban folder table, naming rules, or tracker convention into the overlay; that duplication is exactly how the previous version of this system drifted out of alignment across repos.

## Success Condition

This skill succeeds when work becomes calm, visible, and testable. The user should always know: what matters this session, what's blocking progress, and what issue represents the next concrete action.
